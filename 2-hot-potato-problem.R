# this problem is taken from the Riddler series on fivethirtyeight.com
# if you want some additional practice writing monte carlo simulations
# the Riddler series questions can usually be solved with a monte carlo
# approach.

# A class of 30 children is playing a game where they all stand in a 
# circle along with their teacher. The teacher is holding two things:
# a coin and a potato. The game progresses like this: The teacher tosses 
# the coin. Whoever holds the potato passes it to the left if the coin 
# comes up heads and to the right if the coin comes up tails. The game 
# ends when every child except one has held the potato, and the one 
# who hasn’t is declared the winner.

# How do a child’s chances of winning change depending on where they are 
# in the circle? In other words, what is each child’s win probability? 

# Visualize the final result with a graph that shows the position relative
# to the starting location of the potato on the x-axis and the probability
# of winning on the y-axis.

# this will take some planning to think about how to formalize this problem
# i highly recommend discussing it with a classmate! the simpler you can
# make the abstraction of this problem, the easier it will be to write the
# code. either way, this is a challenging problem so give yourself 
# a high-five when you solve it.
